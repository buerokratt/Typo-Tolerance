# Typo Tolerance

## About

Although this repo contains a service similar to a simple autocorrect, using the name _Type Tolerance_ is an emphasise on accepting faulty / misspelled input from End Users on purpose, instead of autocorrecting it.

The goal is to get as much actual input as possible, be it wrong autocorrect by phone or just bad spelling. All of this is most valuable input for machine learning algorithms.
